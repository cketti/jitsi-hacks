The COVID-19 pandemic has lead to a lot of meetings now happening online. I'm very happy that software from the
wonderful open source project [Jitsi](https://jitsi.org/) is used for many of my video conferences.
Most of the time I'm using the [Jitsi Meet](https://jitsi.org/jitsi-meet/) app in the browser of my desktop computer.
And it's a great experience. But sometimes I wished that a certain feature was available or that the user interface was
different to better fit my use cases.  

Instead of doing the reasonable thing of building the app myself and modifying it according to my needs, I began
changing the app's UI by injecting code via the browser's web developer console. I shared these "hacks" with friends and
soon settled on distributing them as [bookmarklets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bookmarklet) that inject scripts
hosted on *jitsi-hacks.cketti.eu*. It started with very simple modifications and then things kind of spiraled out of
control.

Some of the more useful hacks can be found on this website. [Reordering video tiles](/hacks/reorder/) or
changing your avatar to use it as "[emoji reaction](/hacks/emoji_reaction/)" are only some of the things I've built.
For more check out the "Hacks" entry in the navigation menu of this website.

I hope my Jitsi hacks can bring you some joy. I certainly enjoyed creating them. And since I love open source, of course
all of my work is available under an open source license. You can find everything in my
[jitsi-hacks](https://github.com/cketti/jitsi-hacks) repository.
